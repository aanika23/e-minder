The idea would be more benificial in a commercial environement where the price, unit number, and square footage is changing frequently.
Currently commercial signs just list the name and square footage.

Currently in residential all offers are done in the office or at a person's house.
This could be useful in the event of a price change or a change in branding.
The current cost for a sign is $20-40 for residential or $20-30 for a condo sign.
Commercial signs are one time use, where residential can be used multiple times.

A QR code would be helpful as currently they use stickers which are one time use. 
The turn around time on QR codes signs is 1-2 weeks long.

This sign would be good in an eleveator where people are waiting often.

Lights have a slight benifit, but not that exciting.

Signs last about 2 years.

Would be willing to pay up to $300 for a reusable sign.

Benifits:
Information
- New listing 
- Coming soon
- Price drop
- Sold 
Donâ€™t need to walk over 
Save on labour 

Metal signs are available 

Would be nice to update what unit is avaialble 

Australia still does bidding like an auction

Blind bidding ban is possibly in 2023

Condo sign is a good idea for updating a QR code

Can buy a sign in metal and print info on that sliding the updating info into the sign
